## Summary

My name is Romen Carreno. Im a scattered work-aholic, I enjoy chemistry and skateboarding, people tell me im dense but I usually come to my senses.
I would say my strong suits are that I can work under any condition. Im able to take lead when needed while also able to comply with being a team player.
My weakest suit would have to be how disorganized i can be, while im able to sort it out, it has come to my downfall.
Some of my acheviemts are how i built a punching bag where i hooked up accelerometer with the rasberry pie that recorded data which effected a screen.
And finally as they all say "old hackers never die, they just go into bits" :)
